            Ice-cream is exquisite. What a pity it isn't illegal. A paragraph is a series of 
            related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about 
            paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences 
            that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
